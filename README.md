# The new Peer to Peer messaging framework

This is a template to build your own custom P2P application, with automatic encryption, reconnection, userdata saving, and more

# Features:

 - Integrity checking
   - Automatically checks the integrity of the file before load. If it is modified, it will alert the user, and prevent further use
 - Automatic encryption
   - all communications between peers is automatically encrypted with a temporary session keypair
 - Auto login
   - This uses a login system that uses the user file as the user account. It automatically deals with the storage of the file handler, creation of new files, and importing of old files
 - Version detection
   - This automatically detects when the version is out of date. Auto-updating is coming soon
 - Potential to send data to multiple users at once
   - If you want a group chat system, this has the potential to do that, using a "channel" system
  

# How to use:
 - coming soon. For now, you can use the functions in the command line, after opening up any of the HTML files
